# 🎯 Authentication Testing Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Authentication system implemented and ready for testing**

The application is now running at **http://localhost:5176/** with full AWS Amplify integration.

## Previous Issues Resolved
- ❌ "NoValidAuthTokens: No federated jwt" errors
- ✅ Complete authentication flow implemented  
- ✅ AuthWrapper component with login/signup UI
- ✅ useAuth hook with Cognito integration
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

## Testing Steps

### 1. Sign Up New User
1. Open http://localhost:5176/
2. Click "新規登録" tab
3. Enter:
   - Email: your-email@example.com
   - Password: ComplexPass123!
   - Nickname: TestUser
4. Click "📝 アカウント作成"
5. Check your email for verification code
6. Enter 6-digit code and click "✅ 確認"

### 2. Sign In
1. Switch to "ログイン" tab
2. Enter email and password
3. Click "🔐 ログイン"
4. Should see main application interface

### 3. Test Data Operations
Once authenticated, test:
- ✅ **Add expense**: Should work without auth errors
- ✅ **View expenses**: Should load from GraphQL API
- ✅ **Delete expense**: Should work with proper permissions
- ✅ **Add todo**: Should work without auth errors
- ✅ **Add fridge item**: Should work without auth errors

### 4. Expected Behavior
- **Before auth**: Shows login/signup form
- **After auth**: Shows main application with data
- **No more**: "NoValidAuthTokens" errors
- **Real-time sync**: GraphQL subscriptions should work

## Architecture Overview
```
User -> AuthWrapper -> useAuth -> AWS Cognito
                   |
                   -> Main App -> useExpenses -> GraphQL API
                               -> useTodos -> GraphQL API  
                               -> useFridge -> GraphQL API
```

## Next Development Steps
1. ✅ Authentication working
2. 🔄 Test CRUD operations
3. 📸 Test receipt upload
4. 🔄 Test real-time sync
5. 🚀 Production deployment
